# Building a Real-time Chat App with ReactJs and Firebase.

This project was inspired by an article written by FreeCodeCamp(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-real-time-chat-app-with-reactjs-and-firebase/). The code provided was cloned and edited to suit the purpose of this project.

## Summary

This project aims to make the process of coordinating rideshares easier for university students. 
By providing a live-chat platform and an integrated Google Calendar, users can easily plan their commutes. 

## Next Steps:

- [ ] Connect database entries to Google Calendar API. This is so that ride requests and offers show up on the calendar at specified dates/times.
- [ ] Fix the input format of the Rideshare form. Include dropdown select options for location and time. Include option to specify whether user filling the for is looking for a ride or offering a ride.
- [ ] Use AI/ML algoriths to predict popular ride hours.
